# Website
Repo to track updates to my personal website, nathandsouza.ca
My goals are to learn html, css and javascript in order to build a website I am content with. My current plan of attack is to learn the languages in the order I stated via online lectures such as lynda and linkedin learning. 

Updates and Issues:
- When I first started playing around with my website I found that all the changes I made were via the cpanel. Although this was very convenient the issue with this was that I wanted to track my changes and progress on this repository. I did ssome research and what I learned was that I could push from my local to a remote repo on my site, which would then update the html on the site. This was the perfect solution as I could just as easily push to my github instead of having to copy and paste html files. Setting this post-receive hook up was quite the challenge as many of the guides were outdated. Nevertheless, I now currently have a post-receive hook setup so I can just as easily update this repo as my live site.

- My next issue was designing the site itself. With html/css/javascript I found many resources to learn it and found that this wouldn't be a huge problem for me. Rather what I struggled with was designing the site itself. The code I could learn but I had no clue how to make the site actually look nice and finding resources for that proved to be a bit tougher. What I ended up doing is that I went through countless sites, looking at features I liked and disliked. This in turn gave my a better idea of what I would want my site to look like.
